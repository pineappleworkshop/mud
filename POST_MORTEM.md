**Post-Mortem: zkSync/Foundry Feature Set Additions and Challenges**

As we reflect on the progress made in integrating zkSync/Foundry features into Lattice/MUD project, it's important to acknowledge the advancements achieved as well as the challenges encountered along the way.

**Progress Achieved:**

1. **Enhanced Compilation Options:** We successfully introduced several new flags for the `zkforge zkbuild` command to enhance the flexibility of contract compilation:

   - The `--skip` flag enables users to skip specified folders during compilation.
   - The `--match-contract` flag allows the compilation of only specified contracts.
   - The `-r` flag allows for `local-remapping`

   These additions improve the overall user experience and streamline the development process.

2. **Local Contract Remapping:** We implemented local remapping of contracts in the `zkforge zkbuild` process. This feature pulls all locally imported contracts from the source and writes them to the `zk_remapped_local` directory, simplifying the compilation process by providing a consistent location for imported contracts and bypassing the need to use `remappings`.

3. **Deployment Enhancements:** We created the `zk_deploys` directory to store deployment information, making it easier to manage and track deployment-related data.

4. **Improved Directory Structure:** We made structural improvements to the `zkout` directory to prevent artifacts from being overwritten. These enhancements ensure that compiled contracts and artifacts are organized efficiently.

5. **Efficiency Improvements:** We optimized contract compilation by removing unnecessary iterations, which resulted in shorter compile times. These efficiency improvements contribute to a smoother development workflow.

**Current Challenges:**

1. **Rapid Development of MUD:** One of the primary challenges we faced during this integration was the rapid development pace of MUD. Frequent changes in the MUD codebase, including file deletions, directory relocations, and structural modifications, posed unexpected hurdles. These changes led to breaking some of the foundational aspects of our SDK that relied on the stability of the MUD codebase.

2. **Refactoring Requirements:** Due to the evolving nature of MUD, we recognized the need for ongoing refactoring of our code to accommodate changes in MUD's behavior and structure. This additional work introduced delays and required significant adaptation efforts.

3. **Existing Functionality Breakage:** Some of the existing functionality, such as the `pnpm mud zk` command, which previously compiled and deployed MUD project contracts, broke as a result of MUD's changes. To address this, we introduced a new command, `pnpm mud zkdeploy`, which is a work in progress and currently focuses on World deployment.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, while the integration of zkSync/Foundry features into the Lattice/MUD project has shown promising progress, the fast-paced development of MUD has posed challenges that we need to address. Our team remains committed to resolving these issues and adapting the zkSync/Foundry codebase to the evolving landscape of MUD.

We appreciate the patience and understanding of our community and contributors as we navigate these challenges. Rest assured, we are excited to continue our work on this project and look forward to resuming development as soon as possible.
